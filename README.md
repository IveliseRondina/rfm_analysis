**<h2> 1 - Business Problem </h2>**

**<h2> 1.1 - About BigBox </h2>**

At BIGBox, a multi-brand e-commerce company, the marketing team realized that some customers buy more expensive products with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue. Based on this perception, the marketing team will launch a loyalty program for the best customers in the base, called **Insiders**. 

&nbsp; 

**<h2> 1.2 - The business problem </h2>**

The marketing team does not have advanced knowledge in data analysis to select program participants. For this reason, the data team will select eligible clients for the program, using advanced data manipulation techniques.

As a data scientist at BigBox, you need to determine which customers are eligible to participate in **Insiders**. In possession of this list, the Marketing team will carry out a sequence of personalized and exclusive actions for the group, in order to increase revenue and purchase frequency.
